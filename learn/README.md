# Software Architecture and Design Tutorials

Welcome to this series of tutorial articles focusing on key software architecture and design principles. These articles aim to provide both theoretical explanations and practical examples, often referencing the `genaidemo` project to illustrate concepts in action.

Understanding these principles can help in building robust, scalable, and maintainable software systems.

## Articles

1.  **[01: Introduction to Domain-Driven Design (DDD)](./01-introduction-to-ddd.md)**
    *   Learn about the core concepts of DDD, including Ubiquitous Language, Bounded Contexts, Aggregates, Entities, Value Objects, and Domain Events. Understand how DDD helps in tackling complexity in the heart of software.

2.  **[02: Hexagonal Architecture (Ports and Adapters)](./02-hexagonal-architecture.md)**
    *   Explore the Hexagonal Architecture, also known as Ports and Adapters. Discover how it helps in creating decoupled application cores by separating business logic from infrastructure concerns.

3.  **[03: Event-Driven Architecture (EDA)](./03-event-driven-architecture.md)**
    *   Dive into Event-Driven Architecture, understanding how systems can communicate asynchronously through events. Learn about event producers, consumers, brokers, and common EDA patterns.

We hope these articles provide valuable insights into modern software design.
